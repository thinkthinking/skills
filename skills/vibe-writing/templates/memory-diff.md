## Event To Append

```json
{"event_id":"evt_YYYYMMDD_001","timestamp":"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+08:00","work_id":"short-slug","user_input_summary":"","assistant_action_summary":"","user_response_summary":"","outcome":"accepted|partially_accepted|rejected|unclear","memory_candidates":[]}
```

## Apply Notes

- Ask before applying high-impact memories: MBTI/type claims, long-term personality judgments, strong preferences, taboos, or private facts.
- For low-risk project context, append the event and update the profile record after briefly telling the user.
- Prefer `weaken`, `archive`, or `supersede` when evidence conflicts with an older record.
